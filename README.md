OGRE D Interface
================
Bindings for [OGRE](http://www.ogre3d.org/),  is a scene-oriented, flexible 3D engine written in C++ designed to make it easier and more intuitive for developers to produce applications utilising hardware-accelerated 3D graphics. The class library abstracts all the details of using the underlying system libraries like Direct3D and OpenGL and provides an interface based on world objects and other intuitive classes.

Bindings are based on C bindings named [llcoi](https://bitbucket.org/galaktor/llcoi).

Current status: can perform initilization and engine termination.
